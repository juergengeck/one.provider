connection code in chum sync

write whole words res = response, req = request

nodejs next expect: after processing response send the next request

run chum client, chum server functions in lexical scope to allow multiple ws connections.

- can't assign on.message to both client and server because they overwrite each other.
- can use initialize methods to set state information in client and server.
- if i call clientMessageProcessing each time i get a message what should it return?
  same for the server.
the sync would need to know when it doesn't need to call the onmessage function anymore.
